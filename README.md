## About
A passion project with the goal of emulating Vanilla World of Warcraft.

In no way does this project intend to infringe on Blizzard, their affiliated teams, their products or their rights, and is not affiliated with Blizzard in anyway. This project is intended to be educational and for entertainment purposes only.

## Roadmap
*Currently working on a new detailed milestone overview.*

In no way, shape or form is this project intended to become a full-fledged product. I work on this in my free-time, which is very limited, and for fun. 
The roadmap above is a best-case scenario final product, but may not make it out of prototyping. Any length I can go with this project will be considered a feat in and of itself.

## Disclaimer
This project is undergoing rapid change in its codebase, data structures, object definitions, and general infrastructure and as such, should be considered *wildly* unstable.

Use at your own risk.
