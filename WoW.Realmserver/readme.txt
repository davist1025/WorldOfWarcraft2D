WoW.Realmserver
---------------

all player/player interaction happens within the context of a "Realm," a shared world, separate from authentication and account/character verification, where players interact with npcs,
players, quests and the general game world.

this application needs knowledge of the state of the world only i.e the maps, colliders, the players, etc.
